    All requests to Datadog’s API must be authenticated.
    Requests that write data require reporting access and require an `API key`.
    Requests that read data require full access and also require an `application key`.

    **Note:** All Datadog API clients are configured by default to consume Datadog US site APIs.
    If you are on the Datadog EU site, set the environment variable `DATADOG_HOST` to
    `https://api.datadoghq.eu` or override this value directly when creating your client.

    Search your logs and send them to your Datadog platform over HTTP. Limits per HTTP request are:

    - Maximum content size per payload (uncompressed): 5MB
    - Maximum size for a single log: 1MB
    - Maximum array size if sending multiple logs in an array: 1000 entries

    Any log exceeding 1MB is accepted and truncated by Datadog:
    - For a single log request, the API truncates the log at 1MB and returns a 2xx.
    - For a multi-logs request, the API processes all logs, truncates only logs larger than 1MB, and returns a 2xx.

    Datadog recommends sending your logs compressed.
    Add the `Content-Encoding: gzip` header to the request when sending compressed logs.

    The status codes answered by the HTTP API are:
    - 200: OK
    - 400: Bad request (likely an issue in the payload formatting)
    - 403: Permission issue (likely using an invalid API Key)
    - 413: Payload too large (batch is above 5MB uncompressed)
    - 5xx: Internal error, request should be retried after some time

    Pipelines and processors operate on incoming logs, parsing
    and transforming them into structured attributes for easier querying.

    - See the [pipelines configuration page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines)
      for a list of the pipelines and processors currently configured in our UI.

    - Additional API-related information about processors can be found in the
      [processors documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/processing/processors/?tab=api#lookup-processor).

    - For more information about Pipelines, see the
      [pipeline documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/processing).

    **Notes:**

    These endpoints are only available for admin users.
    Make sure to use an application key created by an admin.

    **Grok parsing rules may effect JSON output and require
    returned data to be configured before using in a request.**
    For example, if you are using the data returned from a
    request for another request body, and have a parsing rule
    that uses a regex pattern like `\s` for spaces, you will
    need to configure all escaped spaces as `%{space}` to use
    in the body data.

    The metrics endpoint allows you to:

    - Post metrics data so it can be graphed on Datadog’s dashboards
    - Query metrics from any time period

    **Note**: A graph can only contain a set number of points
    and as the timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases,
    aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set number.

    Datadog has a soft limit of 100 timeseries per host
    where a timeseries is defined as a unique combination of metric name and tag.
  name: Metrics

    [Monitors](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors) allow you to watch a metric or check that you care about,

    not correspond to genuine issues.

    Datadog Synthetics uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to help you ensure uptime,
    identify regional issues, and track your application performance. Datadog Synthetics tests come in
    two different flavors, [API tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest)
    and [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You can use Datadog’s API to
    manage both test types programmatically.

    For more information about Synthetics, see the [Synthetics overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).

    The tag endpoint allows you to assign tags to hosts,
    for example: `role:database`. Those tags are applied to
    all metrics sent by the host. Refer to hosts by name
    (`yourhost.example.com`) when fetching and applying
    tags to a particular host.

    The component of your infrastructure responsible for a tag is identified
    by a source. For example, some valid sources include nagios, hudson, jenkins,
    users, feed, chef, puppet, git, bitbucket, fabric, capistrano, etc.

    [documentation page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging).

    The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and
    monthly usage across multiple facets of Datadog.
    This API is available to all Pro and Enterprise customers.
    Usage is only accessible for [parent-level organizations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).

    **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was incurred.
    It is retained for the past 15 months.

        Create a monitor using the specified options.

        #### Monitor Types

        The type of monitor chosen from:

        - anomaly: `query alert`
        - APM: `query alert` or `trace-analytics alert`
        - composite: `composite`
        - custom: `service check`
        - event: `event alert`
        - forecast: `query alert`
        - host: `service check`
        - integration: `query alert` or `service check`
        - live process: `process alert`
        - logs: `log alert`
        - metric: `metric alert`
        - network: `service check`
        - outlier: `query alert`
        - process: `service check`
        - rum: `rum alert`
        - watchdog: `event alert`

        #### Query Types

        **Metric Alert Query**

        Example: `time_aggr(time_window):space_aggr:metric{tags} [by {key}] operator #`

        - `time_aggr`: avg, sum, max, min, change, or pct_change
        - `time_window`: `last_#m` (with `#` between 1 and 2880 depending on the monitor type) or `last_#h`(with `#` between 1 and 48 depending on the monitor type), or `last_1d`
        - `space_aggr`: avg, sum, min, or max
        - `tags`: one or more tags (comma-separated), or *
        - `key`: a 'key' in key:value tag syntax; defines a separate alert for each tag in the group (multi-alert)
        - `operator`: <, <=, >, >=, ==, or !=
        - `#`: an integer or decimal number used to set the threshold

        If you are using the `_change_` or `_pct_change_` time aggregator, instead use `change_aggr(time_aggr(time_window),
        timeshift):space_aggr:metric{tags} [by {key}] operator #` with:

        - `change_aggr` change, pct_change
        - `time_aggr` avg, sum, max, min [Learn more](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/monitor_types/#define-the-conditions)
        - `time_window` last\_#m (between 1 and 2880 depending on the monitor type), last\_#h (between 1 and 48 depending on the monitor type), or last_#d (1 or 2)
        - `timeshift` #m_ago (5, 10, 15, or 30), #h_ago (1, 2, or 4), or 1d_ago

        Use this to create an outlier monitor using the following query:
        `avg(last_30m):outliers(avg:system.cpu.user{role:es-events-data} by {host}, 'dbscan', 7) > 0`

        **Service Check Query**

        Example: `"check".over(tags).last(count).count_by_status()`

        - **`check`** name of the check, e.g. `datadog.agent.up`
        - **`tags`** one or more quoted tags (comma-separated), or "*". e.g.: `.over("env:prod", "role:db")`
        - **`count`** must be at >= your max threshold (defined in the `options`).
        e.g. if you want to notify on 1 critical, 3 ok and 2 warn statuses count should be 3. It is limited to 100.

        **Event Alert Query**

        Example: `events('sources:nagios status:error,warning priority:normal tags: "string query"').rollup("count").last("1h")"`

        - **`event`**, the event query string:
        - **`string_query`** free text query to match against event title and text.
        - **`sources`** event sources (comma-separated).
        - **`status`** event statuses (comma-separated). Valid options: error, warn, and info.
        - **`priority`** event priorities (comma-separated). Valid options: low, normal, all.
        - **`host`** event reporting host (comma-separated).
        - **`tags`** event tags (comma-separated).
        - **`excluded_tags`** excluded event tags (comma-separated).
        - **`rollup`** the stats roll-up method. `count` is the only supported method now.
        - **`last`** the timeframe to roll up the counts. Examples: 45m, 4h. Supported timeframes: m, h and d. This value should not exceed 48 hours.

        **Process Alert Query**

        Example: `processes(search).over(tags).rollup('count').last(timeframe) operator #`

        - **`search`** free text search string for querying processes.
        Matching processes match results on the [Live Processes](https://docs.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/process/?tab=linuxwindows) page.
        - **`tags`** one or more tags (comma-separated)
        - **`timeframe`** the timeframe to roll up the counts. Examples: 10m, 4h. Supported timeframes: s, m, h and d
        - **`operator`** <, <=, >, >=, ==, or !=
        - **`#`** an integer or decimal number used to set the threshold

        **Logs Alert Query**

        Example: `logs(query).index(index_name).rollup(rollup_method[, measure]).last(time_window) operator #`

        - **`query`** The search query - following the [Log search syntax](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/search_syntax/).
        - **`index_name`** For multi-index organizations, the log index in which the request is performed.
        - **`rollup_method`** The stats roll-up method - supports `count`, `avg` and `cardinality`.
        - **`measure`** For `avg` and cardinality `rollup_method` - specify the measure or the facet name you want to use.
        - **`time_window`** #m (between 1 and 1440), #h (between 1 and 24)
        - **`operator`** `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, or `!=`.
        - **`#`** an integer or decimal number used to set the threshold.

        **Composite Query**

        Example: `12345 && 67890`, where `12345` and `67890` are the IDs of non-composite monitors

        * **`name`** [*required*, *default* = **dynamic, based on query**]: The name of the alert.
        * **`message`** [*required*, *default* = **dynamic, based on query**]: A message to include with notifications for this monitor.
        Email notifications can be sent to specific users by using the same '@username' notation as events.
        * **`tags`** [*optional*, *default* = **empty list**]: A list of tags to associate with your monitor.
        When getting all monitor details via the API, use the `monitor_tags` argument to filter results by these tags.
        It is only available via the API and isn't visible or editable in the Datadog UI.

    LogsArithmeticProcessor:
      description: |-
        Use the Arithmetic Processor to add a new attribute (without spaces or special characters
        in the new attribute name) to a log with the result of the provided formula.
        This enables you to remap different time attributes with different units into a single attribute,
        or to compute operations on attributes within the same log.

        The formula can use parentheses and the basic arithmetic operators `-`, `+`, `*`, `/`.

        By default, the calculation is skipped if an attribute is missing.
        Select “Replace missing attribute by 0” to automatically populate
        missing attribute values with 0 to ensure that the calculation is done.
        An attribute is missing if it is not found in the log attributes,
        or if it cannot be converted to a number.

        *Notes*:

        - The operator `-` needs to be space split in the formula as it can also be contained in attribute names.
        - If the target attribute already exists, it is overwritten by the result of the formula.
        - Results are rounded up to the 9th decimal. For example, if the result of the formula is `0.1234567891`,
          the actual value stored for the attribute is `0.123456789`.
        - If you need to scale a unit of measure,
          see [Scale Filter](https://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/processing/parsing/?tab=filter#matcher-and-filter).

        **Notes**:

        - The syntax of the query is the one of Logs Explorer search bar.
          The query can be done on any log attribute or tag, whether it is a facet or not.
          Wildcards can also be used inside your query.
        - Once the log has matched one of the Processor queries, it stops.
          Make sure they are properly ordered in case a log could match several queries.
        - The names of the categories must be unique.
        - Once defined in the Category Processor, you can map categories to log status using the Log Status Remapper.

    LogsDateRemapper:
      description: |-
        As Datadog receives logs, it timestamps them using the value(s) from any of these default attributes.

          - `timestamp`
          - `date`
          - `_timestamp`
          - `Timestamp`
          - `eventTime`
          - `published_date`

          If your logs put their dates in an attribute not in this list,
          use the log date Remapper Processor to define their date attribute as the official log timestamp.
          The recognized date formats are ISO8601, UNIX (the milliseconds EPOCH format), and RFC3164.

          **Note:** If your logs don’t contain any of the default attributes
          and you haven’t defined your own date attribute, Datadog timestamps
          the logs with the date it received them.

          If multiple log date remapper processors can be applied to a given log,
          only the first one (according to the pipelines order) is taken into account.
