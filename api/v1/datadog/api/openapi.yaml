        * **`scope`** [*required*]: The scope(s) to which the downtime applies, e.g. `host:app2`.
          Provide multiple scopes as a comma-separated list, e.g. `env:dev,env:prod`. The
          resulting downtime applies to sources that matches ALL provided scopes (i.e.
          `env:dev` **AND** `env:prod`), NOT any of them.

        * **`monitor_tags`** [*optional*, *default*=**no monitor tag filter**]: A comma-separated
          list of monitor tags, i.e. tags that are applied directly to monitors, *not* tags
          that are used in monitor queries (which are filtered by the `scope` parameter), to

        * **`monitor_id`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: A single monitor to which the downtime
          applies. If not provided, the downtime applies to all monitors.

        * **`start`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: POSIX timestamp to start the downtime.
          If not provided, the downtime starts the moment it is created.

        * **`end`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: POSIX timestamp to end the downtime.
          If not provided, the downtime is in effect indefinitely (i.e. until you cancel it).

        * **`message`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: A message to include with notifications
          for this downtime. Email notifications can be sent to specific users by using
           the same '@username' notation as events

        * **`timezone`** [*optional*, *default* = **UTC**]: The timezone for the downtime.
        * **`recurrence`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: An object defining the recurrence of the
          downtime with a variety of parameters:

          * **`type`** the type of recurrence. Choose from: `days`, `weeks`, `months`, `years`.

        * **`monitor_id`** [*optional*, *default*=**None**]: A single monitor to which the downtime

        * **`access_key_id`** [*optional*, *default* = **None**]: If your AWS account is a GovCloud or
          China account, enter the corresponding Access Key ID.

        * **`filter_tags`** [*optional*, *default* = **None**]: The array of EC2 tags (in the form key:value)
          defines a filter that Datadog uses when collecting metrics from EC2. Wildcards, such as ?
          (for single characters) and * (for multiple characters) can also be used. Only hosts that match one
          of the defined tags will be imported into Datadog. The rest will be ignored. Host matching a given
          tag can also be excluded by adding ! before the tag.
          e.g. env:production,instance-type:c1.*,!region:us-east-1 For more information on EC2 tagging,
          see the AWS tagging documentation.

        * **`host_tags`** [*optional*, *default* = **None**]: Array of tags (in the form key:value) to add
          to all hosts and metrics reporting through this integration.

        * **`account_specific_namespace_rules`** [*optional*, *default* = **None**]: An object (in the form
          {"namespace1":true/false, "namespace2":true/false}) that enables or disables metric collection for
          specific AWS namespaces for this AWS account only. A list of namespaces can be found at the
          /v1/integration/aws/available_namespace_rules endpoint.
