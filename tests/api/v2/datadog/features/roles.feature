Feature: Roles
  The Roles API is used to create and manage Datadog roles, what [global
  permissions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/rbac/) they
  grant, and which users belong to them.  Permissions related to specific
  account assets can be granted to roles in the Datadog application without
  using this API. For example, granting read access on a specific log index
  to a role can be done in Datadog from the [Pipelines
  page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines).
