Feature: Downtimes
  [Downtiming](https://docs.datadoghq.com/monitors/downtimes) gives you
  greater control over monitor notifications by allowing you to globally
  exclude scopes from alerting. Downtime settings, which can be scheduled
  with start and end times, prevent all alerting related to specified
  Datadog tags.
