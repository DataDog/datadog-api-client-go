@endpoint(metrics)
Feature: Metrics
  The metrics endpoint allows you to:  - Post metrics data so it can be
  graphed on Datadogâ€™s dashboards - Query metrics from any time period -
  Modify tag configurations for metrics  **Note**: A graph can only contain
  a set number of points and as the timeframe over which a metric is viewed
  increases, aggregation between points occurs to stay below that set
  number.  Datadog has a soft limit of 100 timeseries per host where a
  timeseries is defined as a unique combination of metric name and tag.  The
  Post, Patch, and Delete `manage_tags` API methods can only be performed by
  a user who has the `Manage Tags for Metrics` permission.
