@endpoint(metrics)
Feature: Metrics
  The metrics endpoint allows you to:  - Post metrics data so it can be
  graphed on Datadogâ€™s dashboards - Query metrics from any time period
  **Note**: A graph can only contain a set number of points and as the
  timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases, aggregation between
  points occurs to stay below that set number.  Datadog has a soft limit of
  100 timeseries per host where a timeseries is defined as a unique
  combination of metric name and tag.
