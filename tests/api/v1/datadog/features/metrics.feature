@endpoint(metrics) @endpoint(metrics-v1)
Feature: Metrics
  The metrics endpoint allows you to:  - Post metrics data so it can be
  graphed on Datadogâ€™s dashboards - Query metrics from any time period -
  Modify tag configurations for metrics - View tags and volumes for metrics
  **Note**: A graph can only contain a set number of points and as the
  timeframe over which a metric is viewed increases, aggregation between
  points occurs to stay below that set number.  The Post, Patch, and Delete
  `manage_tags` API methods can only be performed by a user who has the
  `Manage Tags for Metrics` permission.
