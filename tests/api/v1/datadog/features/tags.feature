@endpoint(tags)
Feature: Tags
  The tag endpoint allows you to assign tags to hosts, for example:
  `role:database`. Those tags are applied to all metrics sent by the host.
  Refer to hosts by name (`yourhost.example.com`) when fetching and applying
  tags to a particular host.  The component of your infrastructure
  responsible for a tag is identified by a source. For example, some valid
  sources include nagios, hudson, jenkins, users, feed, chef, puppet, git,
  bitbucket, fabric, capistrano, etc.  Read more about tags on the dedicated
  [documentation page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tagging).
