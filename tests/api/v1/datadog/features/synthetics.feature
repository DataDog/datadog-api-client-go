Feature: Synthetics
  Datadog Synthetics uses simulated user requests and browser rendering to
  help you ensure uptime, identify regional issues, and track your
  application performance. Datadog Synthetics tests come in two different
  flavors, [API
  tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest) and
  [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You
  can use Datadogâ€™s API to manage both test types programmatically.  For
  more information about Synthetics, see the [Synthetics
  overview](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).
