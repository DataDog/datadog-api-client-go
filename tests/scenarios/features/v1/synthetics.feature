Feature: Synthetics
  Datadog Synthetic Monitoring uses simulated user requests and browser
  rendering to help you ensure uptime, identify regional issues, and track
  your application performance. Synthetic tests come in two different
  flavors, [API
  tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/api_tests/?tab=httptest) and
  [browser tests](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/browser_tests). You
  can use Datadog’s API to manage both test types programmatically.  For
  more information, see the [Synthetic Monitoring
  documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/).
