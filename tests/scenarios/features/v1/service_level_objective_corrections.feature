Feature: Service Level Objective Corrections
  SLO Status Corrections allow you to prevent specific time periods from
  negatively impacting your SLOâ€™s status and error budget. You can use
  Status Corrections for various purposes, such as removing planned
  maintenance windows, non-business hours, or other time periods that do not
  correspond to genuine issues.
