Feature: Service Checks
  The service check endpoint allows you to post check statuses for use with
  monitors. Service check messages are limited to 500 characters. If a check
  is posted with a message containing more than 500 characters, only the
  first 500 characters are displayed. Messages are limited for checks with a
  Critical or Warning status, they are dropped for checks with an OK status.
