Feature: Key Management
  Manage your Datadog API and application keys. You need an API key and an
  application key for a user with the required permissions to interact with
  these endpoints. The full list of API and application keys can be seen on
  your [Datadog API page](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#api).
