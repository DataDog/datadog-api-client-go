Feature: Logs Custom Destinations
  Custom Destinations forward all the logs ingested to an external
  destination.  See the [Custom Destinations
  Page](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines/log-forwarding/custom-
  destinations) for a list of the custom destinations currently configured
  in web UI.

  Background:
    Given a valid "apiKeyAuth" key in the system
    And a valid "appKeyAuth" key in the system
    And an instance of "LogsCustomDestinations" API
