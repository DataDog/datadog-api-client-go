Feature: Logs Metrics
  Manage configuration of [log-based
  metrics](https://app.datadoghq.com/logs/pipelines/generate-metrics) for
  your organization.

  Background:
    Given a valid "apiKeyAuth" key in the system
    And a valid "appKeyAuth" key in the system
    And an instance of "LogsMetrics" API
