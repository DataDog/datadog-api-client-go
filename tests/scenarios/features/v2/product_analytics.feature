Feature: Product Analytics
  Send server-side events to Product Analytics. Server-Side Events Ingestion
  allows you to collect custom events from any server-side source, and
  retains events for 15 months. Server-side events are helpful for
  understanding causes of a funnel drop-off which are external to the
  client-side (for example, payment processing error). See the [Product
  Analytics page](https://docs.datadoghq.com/product_analytics/) for more
  information.
