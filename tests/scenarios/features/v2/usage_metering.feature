Feature: Usage Metering
  The usage metering API allows you to get hourly, daily, and monthly usage
  across multiple facets of Datadog. This API is available to all Pro and
  Enterprise customers. Usage is only accessible for [parent-level organizat
  ions](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/multi_organization/).
  **Note**: Usage data is delayed by up to 72 hours from when it was
  incurred. It is retained for 15 months.  You can retrieve up to 24 hours
  of hourly usage data for multiple organizations, and up to two months of
  hourly usage data for a single organization in one request.
