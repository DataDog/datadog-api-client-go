      Description\n\nUpdate your ACL permission to remove `WRITE_ACP` and `FULL_CONTROL`
      accesses for authenticated and unauthenticated public users.\n\n## Rationale\n\n`WRITE_ACP`
      access gives any authenticated AWS accounts or IAM users or unauthenticated
      users READ and WRITE Access Control List (ACL) permissions. `FULL_CONTROL` encompasses
      `WRITE_ACP` so whenever `WRITE_ACP` and `FULL_CONTROL` permissions are granted
      to any AWS `Authenticated User` or `Unauthenticated User`, it grants administrative
      access to view, upload, modify and delete S3 objects without restriction, which
      can lead to potential data loss or unintended charges on your AWS bill.\n\n\n##
      Remediation\n\n### From the console:\n\nFollow the [Configuring ACLs: Using
      the S3 console to set ACL permissions for a bucket][1] docs to remove `WRITE_ACP`
      or `FULL_CONTROL` access and update ACL permissions.\n\n### From the command
      line:\n\n1. Run `put-bucket-acl` with your [bucket name and ACL][2] to `private`.\n\n  ```\n  aws
      s3api put-bucket-acl\n    --bucket your-s3-bucket-name\n    --acl private\n  ```\n\n[1]:
